# config.nvim
My Lua configuration for Neovim on Linux. I mainly use
this setup for [taking notes](https://github.com/kylechui/latex) and doing
homework in LaTeX.
## Screenshots
## Dependencies
* Requires [Neovim Nightly (0.5+)](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/nightly)
* Requires Python 3 (and pynvim) for [UltiSnips](https://github.com/sirver/UltiSnips)
* [Optional] Requires Node.js and yarn for [live previewing markdown files](https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim)
* [Optional] I use [Neovide](https://github.com/Kethku/neovide) as my interface of choice for the animated cursor

#### Why UltiSnips?
To my knowledge, it is the only snippet manager out there that has convenient regexp-based snippets *and* auto-expanding snippets. If there is another snippet manager out there written in Lua or something that has both of the aforementioned features, I'll probably switch to that.
